# Conversions [![PortuguÃªs](https://github.com/daltonserey/FlagKit/raw/master/Assets/PNG/BR.png)](conversions.pt.md)

Write a program that performs the conversions of a Celsius
temperature to its Fahrenheit equivalent. Use the formula below.

![F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=F%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B9%7D%7B5%7DC%20%2B%2032)

## Input

The program input is a single line text containing a number
representing the temperature in Celsius.

Example. The text belows is a valid input to convert 100.0
Celsius.

```
100.0
```

## Output

The program outputs is a single line text containing
the Fahrenheit equivalent to the value read from the
input.

Example. The text below is the output for the input given in the
example above.

```
212.0
```

## Example of execution

The text below is a transcription of the terminal text after the
user has executed a solution to this exercise. The program file
is named
`c2f.py`.

```
$ python c2f.py
100.0
212.0
$
```
